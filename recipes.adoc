== Recipes

In this context, a recipe is a collection of firmware specification
requirements that hardware, firmware, and software providers can
implement to increase the likelihood that software written to the
recipe will run predictably on all conforming devices.

The BRS specification defines two recipes: BRS-I (for "Interoperable")
and BRS-B (for "Bespoke").

=== BRS-I Recipe

The BRS-I recipe aims to simplify end-user experiences, software
compatibility and OS distribution, by defining a common specification
for boot and runtime interfaces. BRS-I is expected to be used by
general-purpose compute devices such as servers, desktops, laptops and
other devices with industry expectations on silicon vendor, OS and software
ecosystem interoperability. BRS-I enables operating system
providers to build a single *generic* operating system image that can be
*successfully booted* on compliant systems. *Generic* means not requiring
system-specific customizations - only an implementation of BRS-I
requirements. *Successfully boot* means basic system configuration,
sufficient for detecting the need for system-specific drivers and
loading such drivers.

It is understood that systems will deliver features beyond those covered
by BRS-I. However, software written against a specific version of BRS-I
must run, unaltered, without *anomalous and unexpected behavior* on
systems that include such features and that are compliant to that specific
version of BRS-I. Such behavior, caused by factors entirely unknown to
a generic OS, is hard to diagnose and always results in a terrible user
experience that negatively affects the value of the whole RISC-V
standards-based ecosystem. *Anomalous and unexpected behavior* is taken
to mean system instability and worst-case behavior for non-specialized
workloads, but does not include suboptimal/unoptimized behavior or
missing I/O or accelerator drivers.

A key tenet of BRS-I is constraining behavior outside the scope of BRS-I.
Features violating the principle of least surprise and causing anomalous and
unexpected behavior in a generic OS must be configured by firmware as opt-in.

=== BRS-B Recipe

BRS-B is intended for cases where only a minimal level of firmware
interaction is mandated, focusing primarily on the boot process.  The
BRS-B recipe is the simpler of the two BRS recipes.  It is expected to
be used by software that is tailored to specific devices.  Examples
include many types of mobile devices, devices with real time response
requirements, or embedded devices running rich operating systems with
custom distributions.
