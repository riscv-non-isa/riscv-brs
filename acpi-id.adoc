=== RVI-specific ACPI IDs

ACPI ID is used in the `_HID` (Hardware ID), `_CID` (Compatibility ID) or
`_SUB` (Subsystem ID) objects as described in the ACPI Specification for
devices, that do not have a standard enumeration mechanism. The ACPI ID
consists of two parts: a vendor identifier followed by a product identifier.

Vendor IDs consist of 4 characters, each character being either an
uppercase letter (A-Z) or a numeral (0-9). The vendor ID SHOULD be
unique across the Industry and registered by the UEFI forum. For RVI
standard devices, `RSCV` is the vendor ID registered. Vendor-specific
devices can use an appropriate vendor ID registered for the manufacturer.

Product IDs are always four-character hexadecimal numbers (0-9
and A-F). The device manufacturer is responsible for assigning this
identifier to each product model.

This document contains the canonical list of ACPI IDs for the namespace
devices that adhere to the RVI specifications. The RVI task groups may
make pull requests against this repository to request the allocation of
ACPI ID for any new device.
