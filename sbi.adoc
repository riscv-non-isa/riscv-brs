== SBI Requirements

The _RISC-V Supervisor Binary Interface Specification_ (SBI) cite:[SBI] defines an interface
between the supervisor mode and the next higher privilege mode. This section
defines the mandatory SBI version and extensions implemented by the higher
privilege mode in order to be compatible with this specification.

| `SBI_010`  | The SBI implementation MUST conform to SBI v2.0 or later.
| `SBI_020`  | The SBI implementation MUST implement the Hart State Management (HSM) extension.
2+| _HSM is used by an OS for starting up, stopping, suspending and querying the status of secondary harts._

Certain requirements are conditional on the presence of RISC-V ISA extensions or system features.
