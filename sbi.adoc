The _RISC-V Supervisor Binary Interface Specification_ (SBI) cite:[SBI] defines an interface
between the supervisor mode and the next higher privilege mode. This section
defines the mandatory SBI version and extensions implemented by the higher
privilege mode in order to be compatible with this specification.
