== BRS-I ACPI Requirements

The _Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Specification_ provides the OS-centric view of system configuration, various hardware resources, events and power management.

This section defines the BRS-I mandatory and optional ACPI
requirements on top of existing ACPI cite:[ACPI] and UEFI cite:[UEFI]
specification requirements. Additional non-normative guidance may be
found in the <<acpi-guidance, firmware implementation guidance>>
section.

IMPORTANT: All content in this section is optional and recommended for BRS-B.

| ID#     ^| Rule
| [[acpi-64bit-clean]]`ACPI_010` a| Be 64-bits clean.

  * RSDT MUST NOT be implemented, with `RsdtAddress` in RSDP set to 0.
  * 32-bit address fields MUST be 0.
2+| _<<acpi-guidance-64bit-clean, See additional guidance>>._
| [[acpi-hw-reduced]]`ACPI_020` a| MUST implement the hardware-reduced ACPI mode (no FACS table).
2+| _<<acpi-guidance-hw-reduced, See additional guidance>>._
| [[acpi-pptt]]`ACPI_030` | The Processor Properties Table (PPTT) MUST be implemented, even on systems with a simple hart topology.
| [[acpi-mcfg]]`ACPI_040` | The PCI Memory-mapped Configuration Space (MCFG) table MUST NOT be present if it violates cite:[PCIFW].
2+| _Only compatible PCIe segments, exposed via ECAM (Enhanced Configuration Access Mechanism), may be described in the MCFG. The MCFG MUST NOT require vendor-specific OS support. See PCI Services (cite:[ACPI], Section 4) for more ACPI requirements relating to PCIe support. <<acpi-guidance-pcie, See additional guidance>>._
| `ACPI_050` | A Serial Port Console Redirection Table cite:[SPCR] MUST be present on systems, where the graphics hardware is not present or not made
available to an OS loader via the standard `UEFI EFI_GRAPHICS_OUTPUT_PROTOCOL` interface.
2+|_In these cases, the table provides essential configuration for an early OS boot console._
| [[acpi-spcr]]`ACPI_060` a| An SPCR table, if present, MUST meet the following requirements:

 * Revision 4 or later of SPCR.
 * For NS16550-compatible UARTs:
 ** Use `Interface Type` 0x12 (16550-compatible with parameters defined in Generic Address Structure).
 ** There MUST be a matching AML device object with `_HID` (Hardware ID) or `_CID` (Compatible ID) `RSCV0003`.

=== BRS-I ACPI Methods and Objects

This section lists additional requirements for ACPI methods and
objects.

<<acpi-guidance-aml, See additional guidance>>.

[width=100%]
[%header, cols="5,25"]
|===
| ID#     ^| Rule
| `AML_010` | The Current Resource Setting (_CRS) device method for a PCIe Root Complex SHOULD NOT return any descriptors for I/O ranges (such as created by ASL macros WordIO, DWordIO, QWordIO, IO, FixedIO, or ExtendedIO).
2+| _Legacy PCI I/O BARs are uncommon in modern PCIe devices and support for PCI I/O space may complicate configuration of PCIe Root Complex hardware in a compliant manner._
| `AML_020` | The Possible Resource Settings (`_PRS`) and Set Resource Settings (`_SRS`) device method SHOULD NOT be implemented.
2+| _ACPI resource descriptors are typically used to describe devices with fixed I/O regions that do not change. Flexible resource assignment is not supported by most modern ACPI OSes._
| `AML_030` | Per-hart device objects MUST be defined under `\_SB` (System Bus) namespace and not in the deprecated `\_PR` (Processors) namespace.
| `AML_040` | Systems supporting OS-directed hart performance control and power management MUST expose these via Collaborative Processor Performance Control (CPPC, cite:[ACPI] Section 8.4.6).
| `AML_050` | Processor idle states MUST be described using Low Power Idle (`_LPI`, cite:[ACPI] Section 8.4.3).
| [[acpi-tad]] `AML_060` | Systems with a Real-Time Clock on an OS-managed bus (e.g. I2C, subject to arbitration issues due to access to the bus by the OS) MUST implement the Time and Alarm Device (TAD) with functioning `_GRT` and `_SRT` methods, and the `_GCP` method returning bit 2 set (i.e. get/set real time features implemented).
2+| _Also see <<uefi-rtc, `URT_020`>>_.
| `AML_070` | Systems implementing a TAD MUST be functional without additional system-specific OS drivers.
2+| _In situations where the Time and Alarm Device (TAD) depends on a
vendor-specific OS driver for correct function (SPI, I2C, etc), the TAD MUST
be functional if the OS driver is not loaded. That is, when a dependent
driver is loaded, an AML method switches further accesses to go
through the driver-backed `OperationRegion`._
| [[acpi-irq-gsb]] `AML_080` | PLIC and APLIC device objects MUST support
the Global System Interrupt Base (`_GSB`, cite:[ACPI] Section 6.2.7) object.
<<acpi-guidance-gsi-namespace, See additional guidance>>.
| `AML_90` | UART device objects with ID `RSCV0003` MUST implement <<acpi-props-uart, Properties for UART Devices>>.
| [[acpi-namespace-dev]]`AML_100` | PLIC/APLIC namespace devices MUST
be present in the ACPI namespace whenever corresponding MADT entries are
present. <<acpi-ids, See RVI ACPI IDs>>.
2+| _Also see <<acpi-irq-gsb, AML_080>> and <<acpi-guidance-gsi-namespace, additional guidance>>_.
