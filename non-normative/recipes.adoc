==== BRS-I Recipe Guidance

Systems compliant to BRS-I can successfully boot an existing generic
operating system image without system-specific customizations, yet
this might result in an unoptimized experience and non-functioning
I/O devices until further software updates are activated.

The best analogy would be a typical Intel Architecture motherboard from
the early 2000s: you could install an OS on it, but the built-in graphics
might be low-resolution and the sound, built-in network port or power
management might not work out of the box. You could subsequently load
the right drivers from the media coming with the board or fetch newest
ones using a well-supported network adapter.
