== BRS-I SMBIOS Requirements

The _System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) Reference Specification_ defines a standard format for presenting management information about an implementation, mostly focusing on hardware components.

This section defines the BRS-I mandatory and optional SMBIOS requirements
on top of existing cite:[SMBIOS] specification requirements. Additional
non-normative guidance may be found in the <<smbios-guidance, firmware
implementation guidance>> section.

IMPORTANT: All content in this section is optional and recommended for BRS-B.

NOTE: The structures and fields in this section are defined in a manner consistent with the DMTF specification language (cite:[SMBIOS]).

=== Type 04 Processor Information

IMPORTANT: The information in this section supersedes the definitions in (cite:[SMBIOS], Section 7.5.3.4).

A processor is a grouping of harts in a physical package. In modern designs this MAY mean an SoC.

For RISC-V class CPUs, the `Processor ID` field contains two `DWORD`-formatted values describing
the overall physical processor package vendor and version. For some implementations
this may also be known as the SoC ID. The first `DWORD` (offsets 08h-0Bh) is the JEP-106 code for
the vendor, where bits 6:0 is the ID without the parity and bits 31:7 represent the number of continuation codes. The second `DWORD` (offsets 0Ch-0Fh) reflects vendor-specific part versioning.

For hart-specific vendor and revision information, please see <<smbios-type44>>.

[[smbios-type44]]
=== Type 44 Processor-Specific Data

The processor-specific data structure fields are defined to follow the standard Processor-Specific Block fields (cite:[SMBIOS], Section 7.45.1).

The structure is valid for processors declared with `Processor Type` 07h (64-bit RISC-V) only.

A Type 44 structure needs to be provided for every hart meeting <<hart>> requirements.

| 00h| 0100h| `Revision`|`WORD`|Varies|See <<smbios-psd-ver>>.
| 02h| 0100h| `Hart ID`| `QWORD`| Varies| The ID of this RISC-V hart.
| 0Ah| 0100h| `Machine Vendor ID` | `QWORD` | Varies| The vendor ID of this
RISC-V hart.
| 12h| 0100h| `Machine Architecture ID` | `QWORD` | Varies| Base
microarchitecture of the hart. Value of 0 is possible to indicate the field is
not implemented. The combination of `Machine Architecture ID` and `Machine Vendor
ID` should uniquely identify the type of hart microarchitecture that is implemented.
| 1Ah| 0100h| `Machine Implementation ID` | `QWORD`| Varies| Unique encoding
of the version of the processor implementation.

=== Processor-Specific Data Structure Versioning

The processor-specific data structure begins with a revision field to allow for future extensibility in a backwards-compatible manner.

The minor revision is to be incremented anytime new fields are added in a backwards-compatible manner. The major revision is to be incremented on backwards-incompatible changes.
