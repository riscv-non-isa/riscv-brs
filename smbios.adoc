== SMBIOS Requirements

The System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) specification defines a standard format for presenting management information about an implentation, mostly focusing on hardware components.

This section defines the BRS-I mandatory and optional SMBIOS requirements
on top of cite:[SMBIOS], and is optional and recommended for BRS-B. Additional non-normative guidance may be found in the <<smbios-guidance, appendix>>.
